Initially I was part of a small cross-functional product team developing a new booking tool based on regular user testing. After a few months this project formed the basis for a new department, called Leaseplan Digital, tasked with building a fresh new global platform from scratch for the different services offered throughout Europe. A vibrant work environment where testing, code reviews and pair programming was an important part of closely working together with dozens of developers in one codebase. In my role as Tech Lead, I’ve focused on code quality, team productivity and continuous development.
