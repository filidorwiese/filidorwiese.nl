Starting out with only a handful of people, we’ve been tasked with rebuilding a global platform from scratch for the different services that Leaseplan has to offer throughout Europe. This project quickly grew into a large department with many experienced developers collaborating to build the best user experience possible. In my role as Tech Lead, I’ve focused on code quality, team productivity and long-term vision.
