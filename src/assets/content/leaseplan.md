At the start, I was part of a cross-functional product team to create a fresh new booking tool. The project quickly grew from a handful of experienced developers into an entire department, where testing, code reviews and pair programming was part of our daily activities. We were tasked with building a new global platform from scratch for the different services Leaseplan offers throughout Europe. In my role as Tech Lead, I’ve focused on code quality, team productivity and long-term vision.
