At KLM I started out in the Scrum team which was responsible for the homepage. A challenging project where diverse code from other teams had to come together. After that Iâ€™ve worked on the Travel Inspiration Finder, a visually pleasing online guide for travelers who are in the orientation phase of their next journey. It offers information about 600+ destinations in 30 languages, which a user can filter based on budget, temperature, interest, etc. The tool has been built with Backbone and was the first project in which I applied both unit and e2e testing to front-end code.
