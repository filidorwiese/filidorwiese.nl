At KLM I started out in the Scrum team responsible for the homepage, a challenging project where diverse code from other teams had to come together. After that Iâ€™ve worked on the Travel Inspiration Finder, a visually pleasing online guide for travelers who are in the orientation phase of their next journey. It offers information about 600+ destinations in 30 languages, which a user can filter based on budget, temprature, interest, etc. The tool has been build with Backbone and was the first project where I applied both unit and e2e testing to front-end code.
