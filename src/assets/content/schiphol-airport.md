At Schiphol Airport I've been working on an in-house application which is used to keep track of the current and ever-changing situation at the terminals. This interactive real-time dashboard is used by Schiphol Operations in several control-rooms to monitor luggage, planes and crowded areas in order to minimize disruptions and optimize the flow of passengers.

As a fullstack developer in one of the feature teams, I've implemented several features, such as a faceted search based on ElasticSearch and an interactive map of areas and corridors. Additionally, I've been focussing on maturing the tech-stack from a prototype to a mission-critical application that can be relied upon 24/7. To that end, I've played a major role in migrating the infrastructure from classic VM's to a cloud-native OpenShift platform and rewriting the codebase to use Kafka as the core for reliably stream-processing thousands of data events per minute.
