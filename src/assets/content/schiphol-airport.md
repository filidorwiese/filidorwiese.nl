Presently I'm working on an internal application for Schiphol which is used to keep track of the current and ever changing situation at the airport terminals. For example, it can be used to monitor the whereabouts of luggage and planes in order to minimize disruptions and optimize the flow of passengers. A challenging project due to the large amount of data and its realtime streaming nature. 

Next to adding brand new features to the application (as a fullstack developer in one of the feature teams) I've been focussing on maturing the tech-stack to support a mission critical application that can be relied upon 24/7. To that end, I've played a major role in migrating the infrastructure from classic VM's to OpenShift and rewriting parts of the codebase to use Kafka as its main source of data.
