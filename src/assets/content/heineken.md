To visualize the fact that Heineken is “the world’s most international brewer”, Mathijs Alderliesten (visual designer) and myself developed an animated, interactive map that a user could use to explore information about their brands and breweries world wide. The responsive and cross-browser requirements of the assignment made it a challenging but fun project. Agency: Jungle Minds
