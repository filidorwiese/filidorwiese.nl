Starting in mid 2014, I was part of a small cross-functional team to create a new vision for the shipping tool, mytnt and mobile app of TNT. After a couple of months of development and extensive user testing we've delivered a prototype that was well received by the company. In the months to follow, the team expanded into an entire new department with the goal to develop the best user experience possible for the TNT global platform. The booking tool I’ve helped to create is currently used in 50+ countries and 30+ languages.
