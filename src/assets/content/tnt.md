Starting in mid 2014, I was part of a small cross-functional team to create a new vision for TNT's shipping tool, mytnt and mobile app. After a couple of months of development and extensive user testing we've delivered a prototype that was well received by the company. In the months to follow, the team expanded into an entire new department. Our goal was to develop the best user experience possible for the TNT global platform. The booking tool Iâ€™ve helped to create is currently used in 50+ countries and 30+ languages.
