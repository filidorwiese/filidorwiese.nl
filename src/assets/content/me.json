    "description": "Sinds 2000 ben ik werkzaam als webontwikkelaar aan diverse projecten voor bedrijven waaronder TNT/Fedex, KLM, Heineken, Amsterdam Arena en Museum of London. In de laatste jaren heb ik me gespecialiseerd in front-end. <br />Als front-end ontwikkelaar zet ik met behulp van moderne technieken een visueel ontwerp omzet in een professioneel en interactief eindproduct. Gebruiksvriendelijkheid, zoekmachine optimalisatie en mobiel gebruik staan hierbij voorop. Mijn voorkeur ligt bij het ontwikkelen van single page webapplicaties met gebruik van moderne frameworks als Angular of React.<br />Daarnaast heb ik gedegen kennis van Linux, CD/DI en developer tools zoals Git, Gulp/Grunt, Webpack, Node/NPM en Docker. Ook schuw ik het schrijven van unit- of end-to-end testen niet.",

      { "author": "Niall McLoughlin, Global Director of Product Development, TNT", "quote": "One of the best developers in the Netherlands. Period. Fili has a wealth of experience in building amazing apps and is highly respected by his peers. Constantly looking for ways to improve, try out new technologies and seeking the perfect customer experience, Fili has a natural tendency to understand the customer dilemma and rally the whole team around delivery of the best solution possible in a pragmatic and iterative manner. Filidor was one of our first recruits and he helped us right the way from building our first prototype through getting one of our flagship products developed, delivered and operated in circa 50 countries worldwide. We really value top quality people. What I've learned is that the best people only want to work with the best people. Having people like Fili in your team will make it much easier for you to find better talent as developers love working with him." },
