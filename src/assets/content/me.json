    "description": "As a freelance front-end developer I have been working on projects for various companies such as  Leaseplan, Fedex/TNT, Amsterdam Arena, Heineken and KLM. My passion is building pixel-perfect applications for the web, using the latest techniques and Javascript frameworks, with an emphasis on performance, usability and search-engine friendliness.<br /><br />In the last few years, I’ve specialized in the development of single page applications for high-traffic websites. To that end, I’m no stranger to unit/e2e testing, prototyping, developer tooling, continuous deployment, version control, user testing and system engineering. I enjoy working together in a product team using Agile/Scrum methodology.<br /><br />Since 1999 I’ve also owned a web hosting company which grew from a single server setup into a large private cloud on self-maintained hardware. These years have given me experience of all facets of the web, from networking, high-availability, server maintenance, dns, caching, mail, virtualization to building custom user interfaces for our clients to manage their domains and services.<br /><br />In my spare time I love diving into new technologies such as game and blockchain development.",

      { "author": "Niall McLoughlin, Global Director of Product Development, TNT", "quote": "One of the best developers in the Netherlands. Period. Fili has a wealth of experience in building amazing apps and is highly respected by his peers. Constantly looking for ways to improve, try out new technologies and seeking the perfect customer experience, Fili has a natural tendency to understand the customer dilemma and rally the whole team around delivery of the best solution possible in a pragmatic and iterative manner. Filidor was one of our first recruits and he helped us right the way from building our first prototype through getting one of our flagship products developed, delivered and operated in circa 50 countries worldwide. We really value top quality people. What I've learned is that the best people only want to work with the best people. Having people like Fili in your team will make it much easier for you to find better talent as developers love working with him." },
