An online experience telling the story of the Great Fire of London in 1666. I technically adapted three historic hand-drawn maps from before and after the fire to exactly overlap the current map of the city. It entailed automated stretching, transforming and slicing the massive image files and visualizing them using the Google Maps Api.
