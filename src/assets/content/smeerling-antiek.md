For this antiques store, I've written a multilingual webshop from scratch using React and Laravel Lumen. It's written as a isomorphic Single Page Application with a RESTful backend and a custom CMS to manage content, products and orders. The webshop works nicely on modern devices and is written to perform well for a global audience. Next to that, I've made it a personal challenge to optimize the codebase for search engines as best as I possibly know how to. Amongst others this includes highly optimized markup, multilingual sitemaps and structured data.

The design is by <a href="http://arthurvanthoog.nl" target="_blank">Arthur van 't Hoog</a>, the 360&deg; virtual tour by <a href="https://virtualtour.nu" target="_blank">Rob Jansma</a>.
