After my <a href="https://galaxy.fili.nl">personal website</a> had won an Awwwards award, I came in contact with Los Angeles based digital agency Wildlife. They asked me to code an extraordinarily complex design they had made to showcase their work. The intense parallax and sprite animations required sought to push the boundaries of what's possible in a web browser. Iâ€™ve had great fun working on this project, which won both a FWA and Awwwards award.
