After my <a href="https://galaxy.fili.nl">personal website</a> had won an Awwwards award in 2011, I was contacted by Wildlife, a Los Angeles based digital agency. They asked me to code an extraordinarily complex design they had made to showcase their work. The many parallax and sprite animations required sought to push the boundaries of what's possible in a web browser. Iâ€™ve had great fun working on this project, which won both a FWA and Awwwards award.
